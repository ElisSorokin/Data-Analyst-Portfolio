# Elisei Sorokin  - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About Me
Hi! I'm Elisei Sorokin. I have a strong background in mathematics and statistics, and I studied economics and finance at the University of Tor Vergata in Rome. Currently, I’m actively developing in the field of data analysis and applying my knowledge in practice.

Throughout my studies and work, I’ve learned how to work with large and complex datasets, analyze user behavior, build metrics, and test hypotheses using Python and SQL. I’ve also gained experience in conducting statistical and A/B tests to support data-driven decision-making.

In my free time, I explore new tools for data analysis and visualization, and I continuously improve my skills in programming and statistics. I enjoy working both independently and in a team and always strive to uncover valuable insights and apply them to real business problems.
My CV is available in[[pdf](https://github.com/ElisSorokin/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Sorokin%20Elisei%20(1).pdf)].

This repository showcases my data analysis skills, project work, and learning progress in data analysis and data science.

**Goal:** Analyze user activity on Yandex.Books and evaluate the impact of a new e-commerce UI via A/B testing.

**Description:** This project contains two independent cases:
1 - Exploring user activity by city on Yandex.Books
2 - Evaluating an A/B test for a new interface on the BitMotion Kit e-commerce platform

**Key Contributions:**
- Cleaned datasets, removed duplicates
- Calculated activity metrics by region and prepared test samples
- Used t-test and Mann–Whitney test to compare users in Moscow vs St. Petersburg
- Validated test design (balance, overlap, duration)
- Calculated conversion rates and applied z-test for comparison
- Prepared a business report with actionable insights

**Skills:** tatistical analysis, A/B testing, hypothesis testing, data cleaning

**Tools:** Python, Pandas, SciPy, Statsmodels, PostgreSQL (SQL)

**Results:** 
- No statistically significant difference in user activity between cities (p > 0.05)
- Median values were more robust due to skewed time distributions
- A/B test showed a 1.7 pp conversion increase (p = 0.0283)

**Conclusion:** The new interface had a positive effect on conversion and was recommended for rollout.

**Goal:** Evaluate the effect of a new recommendation algorithm on user behavior via a properly designed A/B test.

**Description:** End-to-end A/B test analysis—from calculating the required sample size to drawing business conclusions.

**Key Contributions:**
- Analyzed user registrations and group assignments
- Measured page views per session
- Calculated α, β, MDE, and sample size
- Checked group balance and experiment validity
- Used z-test to evaluate statistical significance
- Interpreted results and suggested next steps

**Skills:**   A/B testing, statistical validation, experiment design

**Tools:** Python, Pandas, SciPy, Statsmodels

**Results:**
- Required sample: 17,441 users per group
- Actual: 15,163 (A), 15,416 (B), test duration: 4 days
- Successful session rate: 30.8% (A) vs 31.8% (B)
- p = 0.00015 → statistically significant, but practically small effect

**Conclusion:** Although the test is statistically valid, the practical gain (1.1%) is minimal. A longer and larger-scale test is recommended.
